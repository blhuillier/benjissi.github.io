I am an Assistant Professor in the [Department of Physics and Astronomy][https://sejong.elsevierpure.com/en/organisations/department-of-physics-and-astronomy] at [Sejong University][https://en.sejong.ac.kr/eng/index.do] in Seoul, South Korea. 
My research is funded by the National Research Foundation of Korea.

My research interests focus on falsifying different aspects of the concordance LCDM model using N-body simulations within and beyond LCDM, and advanced statistical methods. I was also a member of the DESI collaboration, involved in the time domain and the cosmological simulations working groups.

​

I completed my PhD at [LERMA][http://lerma.obspm.fr/] , [Paris Observatory][https://obspm.fr/] and [Paris Sorbonne University][https://www.sorbonne-universite.fr/en/education/study-sorbonne-university], working in the Galaxies and Cosmology group with Françoise Combes and Benoit Semelin, and a member of the Momentum project. I was also a Teaching Assistant at the Université Paris Diderot, where I taught Physics and data analysis.

​

After that, I moved to South Korea, a growing hub for research, in particular in Astronomy and Cosmology, and I became a Research Fellow in the [Astrophysics and Cosmology group][https://astro.kias.re.kr/] of the [Korea Institute for Advanced Study (KIAS)][https://kias.re.kr/] in Seoul with Profs. Changbom Park and Juhan Kim on cosmological structure formation, from galaxies to the large-scale structures of the Universe, using numerical simulations such as the Horizon Run 4 simulation. I then moved to the CosKASI group at the Korea Astronomy and Space Science Institute in Daejeon where I was working with Arman Shafieloo. I then became a  Research Professor and W. C. Rufus Fellow working in the Yonsei Observable UNiverse Group (YOUNG)
