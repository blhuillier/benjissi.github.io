## About Me
I am an Assistant Professor in the [Department of Physics and Astronomy](https://sejong.elsevierpure.com/en/organisations/department-of-physics-and-astronomy) at [Sejong University](https://en.sejong.ac.kr/eng/index.do) in Seoul, South Korea.  
I am also an associate member at the [Korea Institute for Advanced Study](https://kias.re.kr/) and the [Center for Gravitational Wave Universe](https://gwuniverse.snu.ac.kr/) at [Seoul National University](https://en.snu.ac.kr/index.html). My research is funded by the National Research Foundation of Korea.

## Research Interests
My research focuses on exploring and falsifying various aspects of the concordance LCDM model using N-body simulations and advanced statistical methods, both within and beyond the LCDM framework. I have been involved in the DESI collaboration, contributing to the time-domain and cosmological simulations working groups.

## Academic Background
I completed my PhD at [LERMA](http://lerma.obspm.fr/), [Paris Observatory](https://obspm.fr/), and [Paris Sorbonne University](https://www.sorbonne-universite.fr/en/education/study-sorbonne-university), working within the Galaxies and Cosmology group with Françoise Combes and Benoit Semelin as part of the Momentum project. I was also a Teaching Assistant at Université Paris Diderot, where I taught Physics and data analysis.

## Professional Experience
After my PhD, I moved to South Korea, an emerging hub for research in Astronomy and Cosmology. I worked as a Research Fellow in the [Astrophysics and Cosmology group](https://astro.kias.re.kr/) at the [Korea Institute for Advanced Study (KIAS)](https://kias.re.kr/), collaborating with Profs. Changbom Park and Juhan Kim on cosmological structure formation, from galaxies to large-scale structures in the Universe, using simulations like the Horizon Run 4 simulation. I then joined the CosKASI group at the Korea Astronomy and Space Science Institute in Daejeon to work with Arman Shafieloo, before becoming a Research Professor and W. C. Rufus Fellow in the Yonsei Observable UNiverse Group (YOUNG).
