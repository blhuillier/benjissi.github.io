      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        I am an Assistant Professor in the <a href="https://sejong.elsevierpure.com/en/organisations/department-of-physics-and-astronomy">Department of Physics and Astronomy</a> at <a href="https://en.sejong.ac.kr/eng/index.do">Sejong University</a> in Seoul, South Korea.
        I am also an associate member at the <a href="https://kias.re.kr/">Korea Institute for Advanced Study</a> and the <a href="https://gwuniverse.snu.ac.kr/">Center for Gravitational Wave Universe</a> at <a href="https://en.snu.ac.kr/index.html">Seoul National University</a>. My research is funded by the National Research Foundation of Korea.

      <h2>Research Interests</h2>
      <p>
        My research focuses on exploring and falsifying various aspects of the concordance LCDM model using N-body simulations and advanced statistical methods, both within and beyond the LCDM framework. I have been involved in the DESI collaboration, contributing to the time-domain and cosmological simulations working groups.

      <h2>Academic Background</h2>
      <p>
        I completed my PhD at <a href="http://lerma.obspm.fr/">LERMA</a>, <a href="https://obspm.fr/">Paris Observatory</a>, and <a href="https://www.sorbonne-universite.fr/en/education/study-sorbonne-university">Paris Sorbonne University</a>, working within the Galaxies and Cosmology group with Françoise Combes and Benoit Semelin as part of the Momentum project. I was also a Teaching Assistant at Université Paris Diderot, where I taught Physics and data analysis.

      <h2>Professional Experience</h2>
      <p>
        After my PhD, I moved to South Korea, an emerging hub for research in Astronomy and Cosmology. I worked as a Research Fellow in the <a href="https://astro.kias.re.kr/">Astrophysics and Cosmology group</a> at the <a href="https://kias.re.kr/">Korea Institute for Advanced Study (KIAS)</a>, collaborating with Profs. Changbom Park and Juhan Kim on cosmological structure formation, from galaxies to large-scale structures in the Universe, using simulations like the Horizon Run 4 simulation. I then joined the CosKASI group at the Korea Astronomy and Space Science Institute in Daejeon to work with Arman Shafieloo, before becoming a Research Professor and W. C. Rufus Fellow in the Yonsei Observable UNiverse Group (YOUNG).
