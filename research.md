## Key Questions in Cosmology
- **What are the fundamental laws that govern the Universe?**
- **What is the Universe made of?**
- **How does the Universe evolve?**
- **What drives the acceleration of the cosmic expansion?**
- **What is the geometry of the Universe?**
- **What are the initial conditions of the Universe?**
- **How do galaxies form and evolve?**

## My Research Approach
To tackle these questions, I focus on studying structure formation at all scales, from galaxies to the large-scale structure of the Universe. My approach combines cosmological simulations with advanced statistical tools to explore the evolution and fabric of the cosmos.

## Current Investigations
My work delves into one of cosmology’s core questions: **Is Einstein's General Relativity the correct description of gravity?** Through simulations and observational data, I test various facets of this theory to understand how gravity shapes the Universe’s large-scale structure.
