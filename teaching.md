# Passing knowledge to a new generation

During my career, I had the opportunity to teach different topics (physics, data analysis, cosmological simulations in different languages (French and English) and at different levels (Undergrad to Ph.D. level).

I gave a lecture on cosmological simulations at [Kyunghee University](https://khu.elsevierpure.com/en/organisations/astronomy-space-science), and  hands-on sessions on cosmological simulations at the [Pyeongchang Summer Institute 2015](http://psi.kias.re.kr/2015/sub03/sub03_01.php).

I was also invited at the [Indian Institute for Astrophysics](https://www.iiap.res.in/) (Bangaore) to teach cosmological simulations. 

During my Ph.D., I was a teaching assistant at the [Université Paris Cité](https://u-paris.fr/en/), where I gave tutorials in Physics and in data analysis for Earth sciences.
